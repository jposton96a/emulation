[Emulation](https://github.com/jposton96a/emulation)
======

This repository holds a collection of my emulator projects. Currently, it only consists of a basic Chip8 emulator and a few roms for it, but I hope to add more emulators as well as assemblers, disassembler, and compilers for each.

Future Emulation Projects Include: 
* Commodore 64 (MOS Technology 6510/8500)  
* Gameboy Color (Zilog Z80 Processor)  
* Gameboy Advance (ARM7TDMI & Z80)
